## How it works

Each month, we gather at UQ Central Library to help solve each other's problems and discover new features. We begin with a brief demonstration before diving into group discussion.

Bring along your python questions, problems, conundrums, opinions and victories to share with the group. We'll try our best to help you out!

We currently use HedgeDoc, a collaborative markdown editor, so you can share your code easily. You can access this very page by going to the short link here: [bit.ly/uqpug](https://bit.ly/uqpug). To add your questions, press the pencil in the top write corner and simply type them in!
